# What is data structure

A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used in effciently

---

A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationship among them, and the function or operations that can be applied to the data

# Why learn data structures?

Almost every application we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way

---

To efficiently mange that data, you need data structures

---

Imagine walking info a libray only to find out there is no efficient organization of the books and they are stored randomly

---

The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds or even minutes comes down to the selection of the right data structure

---

Data structures help your solve problem in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory

---

Learning about data structures also you gain a more profound understanding of things you're already aware of

Data structures help you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory. Moreover, learning

about data structures gives you a deeper understanding of concepts you're already familiar with:

- DOM: Modeled as a Tree data structure
- Browser back and forward functionality: Implemented using a Stack data structure
- Operating System job scheduling: Utilizes Queue data structure

## Built-in Data Structures

1. **Arrays**: Ordered collection of elements with constant-time access to individual elements using an index.
2. **Objects**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
3. **Sets**: Collection of unique elements with no duplicate values.
4. **Maps**: Collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique.

## Custom Data Structures

1. **Stacks**: Collection of elements with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) access.
2. **Queues**: Collection of elements with First-In-First-Out (FIFO) access.
3. **Circular Queues**: Variant of queues where the end points to the beginning, forming a circular structure.
4. **Linked Lists**: Collection of nodes where each node points to the next node in the sequence.
5. **Hash Tables**: Data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing for fast retrieval based on keys.
6. **Trees**: Hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with one node designated as the root.
7. **Graphs**: Collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges (links), representing relationships between entities.

Learning and understanding these data structures is fundamental for building efficient and scalable software systems.
