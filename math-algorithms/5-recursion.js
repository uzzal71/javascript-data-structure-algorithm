/**
 What is Recursion?
 Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
 Recursion is when a function calls itself

 Why recursion?
 A great technique to simplify your solution
 If you find yourself bracking down your problem into smaller version of the same problem, recursion is very useful
